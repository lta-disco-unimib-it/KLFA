/**
 * A wordState returns a word from a reader. Like other 
 * states, a tokenizer transfers the job of reading to this 
 * state, depending on an initial character. Thus, the 
 * tokenizer decides which characters may begin a word, and 
 * this state determines which characters may appear as a 
 * second or later character in a word. These are typically 
 * different sets of characters; in particular, it is typical 
 * for digits to appear as parts of a word, but not as the 
 * initial character of a word. 
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, the following characters may appear in a word.
 * The method <code>setWordChars()</code> allows customizing
 * this.
 * 
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     From    To
 *      'a', 'z'
 *      'A', 'Z'
 *      '0', '9'
 *
 *     as well as: minus sign, underscore, and apostrophe.
