/**
 * A tokenizer divides a string into tokens. This class is 
 * highly customizable with regard to exactly how this division 
 * occurs, but it also has defaults that are suitable for many 
 * languages. This class assumes that the character values read 
 * from the string lie in the range 0-255. For example, the 
 * Unicode value of a capital A is 65, so 
 * <code> System.out.println((char)65); </code> prints out a 
 * capital A.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The behavior of a tokenizer depends on its character state 
 * table. This table is an array of 256 <code>TokenizerState
 * </code>  states. The state table decides which state to 
 * enter upon reading a character from the input 
 * string. 
 *
 * <p>
 * For example, by default, upon reading an 'A', a tokenizer 
 * will enter a "word" state. This means the tokenizer will 
 * ask a <code>WordState</code> object to consume the 'A', 
 * along with the characters after the 'A' that form a word. 
 * The state's responsibility is to consume characters and 
 * return a complete token.
 * 
 * <p>
 * The default table sets a SymbolState for every character 
 * from 0 to 255, and then overrides this with:
 *
 * <blockquote><pre>
 *     From    To     State
 *       0     ' '    whitespaceState
 *      'a'    'z'    wordState
 *      'A'    'Z'    wordState
 *     160     255    wordState
 *      '0'    '9'    numberState
 *      '-'    '-'    numberState
 *      '.'    '.'    numberState
 *      '"'    '"'    quoteState
 *     '\''   '\''    quoteState
 *      '/'    '/'    slashState
 * </pre></blockquote>
 * 
 * In addition to allowing modification of the state table, 
 * this class makes each of the states above available. Some 
 * of these states are customizable. For example, wordState 
 * allows customization of what characters can be part of a 
 * word, after the first character.
