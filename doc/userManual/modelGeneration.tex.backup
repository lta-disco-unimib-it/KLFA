\section{Model Generation}

In this phase the log files collected are analyzed by the system to
derive a model that generalizes the application behavior.
In this phase the initial logs files are preprocessed with different
tools in order to:
\begin{itemize}
 \item have a complete event in a single line
\item automatically detect event types and associated parameters
\item detect rewriting strategies for parameters
\item infer a model of the log files structure
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{modelGenerationComponents} shows the components involved
in this phase. All the components must be called from command lines
and the user has to set parameters according to the analysis type and
the
