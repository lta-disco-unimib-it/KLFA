This folder contains several KLFA examples.

Each example provides shell scripts to invoke the proper KLFA java classes.

Scripts assume that the environment variable KLFA_HOME is properly set, 
and that the environment variable $PATH contains $KLFA_HOME/bin/.


We suggest to inspect the examples in the following order:

issre_demo_manualTransformers_readable

issre_demo_manualTransformers

issre_demo_autoTransformers
